/**
 * Compressed suffix tree class
 *
 * Suffix tree is represented using several compressed       
 * data structures. Most important to understant the usage       
 * of the Balanced Parantheses (BP) representation of the tree   
 * hierarchy: the tree is traversed prefix order printing "("    
 * when a node is visited first time and printing ")" when       
 * a node is visited last time. E.g. "((()())())" is a tree with 
 * root having two children, its left child having two leaves,   
 * and its right child being a leaf.                             
 *                                                               
 * A node in the tree is represented by the index of the         
 * corresponding "(" in the balanced parentheses representation.
